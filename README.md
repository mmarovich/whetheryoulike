## About

WhetherYouLike is a prototype mobile application that allows the user to customize their smartphone background.
They can change whether they want to look at the Time, Date, Weather, Webcams, or change the color of both the
background and the elements in the foreground.  Then, they can drag those elements to where they want on the
screen.  

They can save these settings, so that the next time they log in, their elements and positions are saved exactly
the way they left them.

## Languages and Libraries

WhetherYouLike is written in React.js and Redux, however is in the process of being converted to React Native.

User passwords are hashed securely using bcrypt on a Node.js backend.
