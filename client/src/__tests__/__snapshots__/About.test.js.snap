      WhetherYouLike is a mobile app prototype that creates a customized background for your mobile device.  You can switch on various information, such as time, date, weather, and webcams, as well as change color themes for both the background and elements.  After that, you have the ability to drag those elements where ever you would like them to be on-screen. This is more versatile than a typical widget, where you drag the widget around within a 3 by 6 grid, effecting the position of your icons.  This sets the background of your mobile device so that your icons and other widgets remain where you want them.

      This project is going to be converted to the mobile app language of android (React Native, and perhaps later on, Kotlin).  I can also see more elements and options being added over time. As an example, temperature highs and lows for the day, or record highs and lows from the past.  I'd also like to add a feature where instead of a solid background, the user has the choice to upload a picture of their choice.
